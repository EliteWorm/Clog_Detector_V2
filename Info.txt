Keep in mind that this board will never appear as a COM port in the Arduino IDE.

1. Make sure that the Digistump windows drivers are installed (Digistump.Drivers folder).
2. Burn the micronucleus bootloader to the board (Digiducky.zip file).
3. Upload the code using the Arduino IDE, and only plug the board when asked.
